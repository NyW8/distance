  <div id = "about">
  <h2 style="margin-left:10%;margin-right:10%;"> Our team is based in Austin, Texas and consists of four college students, introduced to each other through Google’s Computer Science Summer Institute
    at their Austin Headquarters. We decided on the team name Distance because we will be attending school in different states and even countries, and
    also because our application explores places around the world. We are a very diverse team and wanted to create an application that could further our
    knowledge of different nations and cultures, which introduced the idea of Globe Notes. We hope that you enjoy our product and learn something new.
